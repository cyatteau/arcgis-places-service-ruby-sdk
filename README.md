# Ruby SDK for the ArcGIS Places Service

This Ruby SDK, generated from the OpenAPI specification with the OpenAPI generator, facilitates integration with the ArcGIS Places Service, allowing Ruby developers to leverage the location-based service in their applications.

## Features

- Autogenerated from the OpenAPI specification with the OpenAPI generator for the ArcGIS Places Service.
- Includes comprehensive documentation and sample usage to help get started quickly.
- Simplifies interactions with the ArcGIS Places Service, providing a seamless developer experience.

## Using the Test Script

The included test script demonstrates the use of the nearby place search feature to find restaurants within the Palm Springs area, with a cap of 30 places. This script is a practical example of how to interact with the ArcGIS Places Service using this Ruby SDK.

### Key Features of the Test Script

- **Location-Based Search**: Targets Palm Springs (latitude 33.8303, longitude -116.5453) to find nearby places.
- **Search Cap**: Limits the search to 30 places to ensure the results are manageable.
- **Category Filtering**: Focuses on restaurants by using the category code '13000'.
- **Pagination**: Iterates through results pages to fetch all relevant places up to the cap.

### Running the Script

1. Ensure Ruby is installed on your machine.
2. Clone the SDK repository and navigate to the test script directory.
3. Run `bundle install` to install dependencies.
4. Be sure to update the file path in the script to match your local setup.
5. Configure the `access_token` in the script with your API key:

   ```ruby
   OpenapiClient.configure do |config|
     config.access_token = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
   end
6. Execute the script:

    ```bash
    ruby test_script.rb
  
After running the script, you should have an HTML file that lists all the restaurants found, demonstrating how to use the SDK to interact with the ArcGIS Places Service effectively.
